Welcome to Giggle, your new meme organizer! The days of endlessly searching for a meme through your camera roll, iMessage conversations, or Instagram bookmarks are long gone. 

Giggle is an app that allows you to save photos, GIFS, and videos to one central spot. Giggle uses AI to tag these media based off their content and sentiment to make them easy to search for in the future. Giggle also groups similar memes together, lets you favorite your most prized memes, and keeps track of which memes you shared recently. 

## Features
- Import photo, GIF, and video memes from your camera roll or other platforms such as Twitter, iMessage, Google, etc.
- Automatically tag meme content and sentiment with AI 
- Search for and share your memes through the app 
- Use the Giggle iMessage extension to quickly find and send memes when texting friends
- Favorite your most prized memes for quick access
- Keep track of which memes you recently shared
- Generate memes with access to OpenAI's DALLE-3 API

Despite being a simple idea of a searchable meme database, Giggle interacts with a variety of iOS' APIs and third-party APIs: 
- [iOS iMessage Extension API](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/messages/)
- [iOS Share Extension API](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/General/Conceptual/ExtensibilityPG/Share.html)
- Xcode [SwiftData](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftdata/) for media and metadata storage
- SwiftUI [AppStorage](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/appstorage)
- Multiple ChatGPT APIs/versions for content and sentiment analysis
- DALL-E API for generating images

## Back-End

## Setting up the server

Use [AWS](https://eecs441.eecs.umich.edu/asns/chatter-backend#aws) to create your own instance and keep track of your public key.

[Ssh](https://eecs441.eecs.umich.edu/asns/chatter-backend#ssh-to-instance) into your AWS instance and pull the repo onto your server.

Modify all instances of "YOUR_SERVER_IP" (which will be 18.223.212.43 in our code) from the following [spec](https://eecs441.eecs.umich.edu/asns/chatter-backend#python-with-django) with your AWS public ip while replacing all instances of "441/chatterd" from the spec with "Giggle/Giggle_backend" when entering and moving directories.

Follow the installation guidelines for [Python, Django, and Gunicorn](https://eecs441.eecs.umich.edu/asns/chatter-backend#install-python) and setup [Gunicorn](https://eecs441.eecs.umich.edu/asns/chatter-backend#setup-gunicorn), but do not make new directories for the environment and use "Giggle/Giggle_backend" instead.

Install all dependent libraries on server through the terminal (openai, Pillow, requests) if u wish to edit and test the code.

Whenever updating any of the respective files for the server run [these commands](https://eecs441.eecs.umich.edu/asns/chatter-backend#summary-configuration-files) to restart the server with your changes.
