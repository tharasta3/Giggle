## UI/UX Design

### Home Screen
Github Link: 

[Home Screen Code](https://github.com/rgperry/Giggle/blob/main/Giggle/Giggle/ContentView.swift)

* App Name: Giggle
* Immediately available app functionality
* No account needed to use
* Preset folders and organized meme library presented

Folders are presented as an alternative method of finding the user's desired meme by organizing the home page with a clear destination.

### Folder Views
Github Link: 

[Folder Views Code (inside the folders)](https://github.com/rgperry/Giggle/blob/main/Giggle/Giggle/GiggleItem.swift)

For each folder, memes that are tagged with the folder’s name are presented in a grid. Each meme has a heart button which can be clicked to favorite and unfavorite a meme. This heart has been enlarged since UI/UX tests showed users had a hard time tapping on it. Short tapping on each meme takes you to the meme info view, while long tapping on the meme presents the iOS Activity View.

Throughout our UI/UX tests we had participants navigate between different folders as well as accessing other UI/UX features and found that they were able to successfully do so.

### Meme View
Github Link: 

[Meme Information View Code](https://github.com/rgperry/Giggle/blob/main/Giggle/Giggle/MemeInfoView.swift)

Meme View allows users to explore individual memes in detail. When a meme is selected, it opens in the Meme View and displays the meme's information. Each meme has tags relevant to its content as determined by ChatGPT. The "More Info" section provides metadata about the meme. Users can add or modify tags for better organization. The favorite button adds the meme to favorites and a delete button removes the meme from the library. The share button enables users to share memes directly from the app to social media, messaging apps, or save them to their device’s clipboard.

In our UI/UX tests, users were very successful in finding this view, and the button design is very intuitive in implying their functionality.

### Search For Meme
Github Link: 

[Search Bar and Folders Code](https://github.com/rgperry/Giggle/blob/main/Giggle/Giggle/FolderView.swift)

The search functionality allows users to find memes directly using a search bar. Users can search by keywords or tags to quickly locate specific memes. In addition to searching, users can also access their favorited memes, and recently accessed memes. Search results are displayed in an organized grid making it simple for users to browse and select the desired meme efficiently.

### Generate Meme
Github Link: 

[Generate Meme View Code](https://github.com/rgperry/Giggle/blob/main/Giggle/Giggle/GenerateMemeView.swift)

Giggle enables users to generate memes using AI integration. Users can input a text description or prompt, such as "Meme with a dog who doesn’t like exercise," and the app uses DALL-E to create a custom meme. Once the meme is generated, users have the option to save it directly to their library or regenerate it to meet their needs. Each generated meme is automatically tagged based on its content ensuring it is well-organized within the app’s library.

Our participants of our UI/UX tests struggled to understand when a meme was saved so we added a popup banner telling them the meme was successful.

[Image Picker Code](https://github.com/rgperry/Giggle/blob/main/Giggle/Giggle/CameraRollView.swift)

When users click on the "Insert from Camera Roll" option, you will be able to browse and select the desired image to import. Giggle will automatically import it into the app. Once the meme is imported, users will be taken to the Meme View, where the imported meme is being displayed. Adding tags, favoriting it, or deleting it are all options for this new imported meme. Users can share it directly from the app to social media, messaging apps, or save them to their device.

Our participants of our UI/UX tests struggled to understand when a meme was uploaded so we added a popup banner telling them the meme was successful.

### Share Meme (Long tap)
Github Link: 

[Share Meme Implementation](https://github.com/rgperry/Giggle/blob/main/Giggle/Giggle/GiggleItem.swift)

Long-tapping a meme opens the iOS activity view, allowing users to copy the meme to their clipboard, share the meme, or delete the meme.
The long tap feature (done on a meme in the folder view) is one of the less intuitive processes for users. However, with the alternative being to add in a permanent button or to interact some other way with the meme, it made sense to keep it as is since some users were still able to identify this functionality.

### iMessage Extension

[Behavior per cell](https://github.com/rgperry/Giggle/blob/main/Giggle/Giggle_IMessage/ImageCell.swift)

The iMessage Extension enables users to browse and share memes directly within iMessage, streamlining the process of finding and sending relevant images. When a meme is selected, it is attached to the iMessage currently being written. A search bar at the top provides efficient meme filtering, helping users find specific content without leaving the messaging context. Our design choices focused on creating an engaging, efficient experience that allows users to interact with memes as an extension of their conversation, rather than a separate process to ensure a smooth and enjoyable flow in meme sharing.
