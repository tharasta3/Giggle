# **Griffin Gong:**

> My primary focus was on front-end development. I designed and implemented various user interface components using SwiftUI, ensuring a smooth and engaging user experience. My responsibilities included building the Generate Meme View, Meme Info View, and Meme Created View, incorporating functionality like generating a meme, displaying meme information, image display, tagging, and navigation. My work focused on creating a responsive, intuitive interface while maintaining robust connectivity to backend systems, enhancing both the app's functionality and overall user experience.

# **Karan Arora:**
> As the team member who originally pitched Giggle, I wore multiple hats. From a software engineering perspective, I directly worked on and contributed to most frontend files. From a "leadership" perspective, I 1) reviewed almost all Pull Requests to keep track of progress and remain up to date on how the app was growing, 2) led our weekly team meetings discussing progress and sprint items to complete, 3) delegated tasks to my teammates, 4) followed up with teammates to check on progress, 5) met with teammates individually to discuss their tasks, overall concerns, and unmerged Pull Requests, 6) corresponded with the professor about expectations for features, 7) helped teammates fix bugs in their code, 8) reviewed and added finishing touches to assignments before submitting them, and 9) shaped the overall direction of the app throughout the ideation, design, and implementation phases.  

# **Matthew Drutis:**
> During the development of this app, I focused mostly on the backend/database integration. I did the research on choosing an approach for storing the memes, and tags, as well as implementing the swiftData database for local persistence of the memes. I also developed various frontend integrations, ensuring that images/videos/gifs were persisted efficiently while also not slowing down the UX for the user. I also did research for choosing a suitable meme search algorithm. This involved iterating with different search approaches and predicates, as well with vector search.

# **Razeen Maroof:**

> In this project, my primary focus was backend development. I set up and managed the backend server on AWS, using Python Django to ensure smooth updates and functionality. I developed the backend systems for generating and regenerating memes, as well as contributed to image tagging by integrating OpenAI models, including DALL-E 3 for generation and ChatGPT-4o mini for vision. Additionally, I connected API calls to our frontend files, enabling seamless integration for our team. My work centered almost entirely on backend server development and ensuring the APIs were fully integrated with the frontend, allowing the team to utilize them effortlessly without concerns about integration challenges.

# **Robert Perry:**

> In the development of this app, I was focused on the front end. I helped set up the initial framework for our UI including the formatting of folders, the navigation bar, and the “Favorite” button on each meme. I also connected parts of the front end to the back end, which was mainly our implementation of storing GIFs and videos and retrieving tags for them based on sentiment and content present. Another main area of my development was the fine-tuning of how the app handles and presents a meme item, with a focus on playing (and looping) GIFs and videos when a user clicks on them. I was also the initial creator of the Giggle Share Extension which allows users to save memes to Giggle from 3rd-party sources.

# **Saamiya Siddiqui:**
> I worked on both backend and frontend development to help make the app functional and easy to use. On the backend, I focused on writing API calls to generate and regenerate memes, extract tags from memes for categorization, making sure they worked smoothly and efficiently. I also integrated OpenAI models like DALL-E 3 for creating memes and ChatGPT-4 Vision for tagging, which added advanced features for recognizing and suggesting memes. On the frontend side, I helped connect these API calls to the user interface so everything worked seamlessly together.

# **Tamaer Alharastani:**
> I developed the iMessage extension for Giggle, enabling users to search for, share, and interact with memes directly within iMessage. I also worked on the frontend implementation and algorithm design for sentiment analysis within the extension, allowing the app to suggest memes based on user sentiment. Additionally, I developed the Share extension, which enables users to save images from other apps into the Giggle database. My contributions focused on frontend development, including optimizing the interface to efficiently load images from the backend, implementing memory management techniques to handle only visible images, and ensuring smooth performance. I collaborated closely with the team to integrate these features with the database and backend systems, delivering a seamless and engaging user experience.
